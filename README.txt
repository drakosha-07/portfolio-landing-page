Project Name: Dasha's Portfolio Landing Page
Date: 11/26/20

Project description: a basic HTML webpage that serves as a landing page for the programming portfolio. Contains links to the current and past projects on Github and the projects' descriptions. Contains an 'About Me' tab that provides information about the author.

Built with:HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

Setup instructions: double-click on the index.html file to open in the browser. The file can be used without the internet connection but the images that are linked to other websites will not display. 

Known bugs: the author was unable to make the content on the 'About Me' tab display at the top of the page. It also looks like the links from the 'Home' tab can be accessed on 'About Me' tab as if the two tabs were still joined on one page.
